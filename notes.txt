1. shape.f    --> call only one time, directly after parseinput

2. solids part can now handle both hyperelastic material and linear elastic material
option 1 --> hyperelastic material
option 2 --> linear elastic material

3. fixed one bug in the /ifem_before_rkem -> doesn't take initial conditions
uncomment ds(1:ndf,1:nn) = eps1 in subroutine formd in form.f90

4. fixed one bug in r_stiff.f90 subroutine
	predrf(nu1)=predrf(nu1)+fu*w
	it was '-' before, but according to the equation, it should be '+'
--------------------------
ifem-v4 fix, 02/03/2005
found bugs in fluid solver
1. the stabilization parameter defined in the momentum term is wrong. One term multiplied by prs_c, and is now multiplied by prs_cc.
	fixed in both block.f and blockgmres.f
2. In form.f90, remove (if idf<ndf) statement when apply boundary conditions. 
3. In blockgmres.f90, the statement res_c=(res_c+(...))/alpha is changed to
     res_c=res_c+(...)/alpha
4. in lenght.f90, the statement hg=V^(1/3), if(twod)hg=sqrt(V), if (nen=4) hg=(8*V)^(1/3) 
is changed to if (nsd=3) ...and if (nen=4) hg=(8*V)^(1/3) endif, if (nsd=2) hg=sqrt(V).
Now, now the nen=4 is included in the 3D only.
5. quad2d4n.f90
if (igau=1) then gau(1:3,1)=-1 is changed to gau(1:2,1)=0.00
6.  In parseinput.f90
 when call read_int(static_onoff,1)..... elseif (static_off=0) then...
Before it was elseif(hg_vol_onoff=0)
7. Cleaned all the warnings - unused variables.

option 1 --> hyperelastic material
option 2 --> linear elastic material

3. fixed one bug in the /ifem_before_rkem -> doesn't take initial conditions
uncomment ds(1:ndf,1:nn) = eps1 in subroutine formd in form.f90

4. fixed one bug in r_stiff.f90 subroutine
	predrf(nu1)=predrf(nu1)+fu*w
	it was '-' before, but according to the equation, it should be '+'

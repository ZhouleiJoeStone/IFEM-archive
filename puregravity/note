I have run three type of materals y=0.1 , y=1000, y=100000 which count gravity(g=980 cm/s^2) influence only . For the last tow cases, dt=0.005, since when y is pretty large here, we have to choose smaller time step or it will just stop because of negative determinant of jacobi. From these three cases, we can clearly find out the difference between hard and soft materials. 
PS: The movies I plot are not from the results files I uploaded here. What I uploaded here is a brief version of the results, since it may be difficult for you to download a large number of files. Therefore, if you need some more detialplots, please just let me know.
